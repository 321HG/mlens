# Development

## Front end roadmap

The project is rapidly progressing. The parallelized backend is in place so the coming taks is to develop the front-end API for different types of ensembles need to be built. This however is a relatively straightforward task so expect major additions soon. In the pipeline of Ensembles to be implemented are currently: 

- Blending
- Super Learner
- Subsemble

## Back end roadmap

Currently, parallelization is maximized by pre-making the preprocessed folds / data. This however will not scale well to very large datasets, and an alternative is to cache fitted preprocessing pipelines, to avoid repeatedly fitting them. This should not be a hard task to accomplish, as it only requires storing the fitted pipelines and calling them when necessary.
